# QuickFIleWeb

## About
Quick File Web is the web part of a project that I made for my personal use. It coupled with the android app allows me to share with public systems just by logging in the webapp via a otp.  

However it's not very secure but it doesn't matter for all school/college related purposes I had in mind.
